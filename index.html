    <h2>5. Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      The entry from March 3, 2020 focuses on the tension between collective overload and individual responsibility. Fang Fang’s language shifts between documentary sobriety and personal empathy. Her critique is subtle but firm: the state was overwhelmed while individuals stepped up. The contrast between governmental passivity and civic initiative runs throughout the entry.
